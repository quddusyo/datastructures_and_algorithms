# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms

A curated collection of common data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. This repository serves as a reference and practice resource for mastering DSA fundamentals — great for interview prep, computer science revision, and building coding confidence.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This repository includes clean and well-commented Python implementations of:

### 🧱 Data Structures
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks & Queues
- Hash Tables (Dictionaries)
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
- Heaps
- Graphs

### 🔁 Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Radix, etc.)
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Traversals (BFS, DFS)
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Prim’s)

### Getting Started: Clone the Repo
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/quddusyo/datastructures_and_algorithms.git
